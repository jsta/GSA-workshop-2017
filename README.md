# GSA workshop 2017

This is a repository for materials related to the visualization in R workshop held at GLEON 19. The morning session will be focused on individuals who are new to R, and thus we will cover the basics of programming, importing/exporting data, and basic visualizations. The afternoon session will be focused on individuals who have some R skills, and thus will focus on more advanced data visualization skills.

# Before you come to the workshop...

1) Download and install both R and RStudio. If you already have these installed, please update them both.
2) Download the data for the course by navigating to your session folder in this repository and downloading everything in the "data" subfolder. 
3) Create a new R Project called "GSA_workshop_2017" and create three folders within this project: "data", "scripts", and "figures".
4) Move the downloaded data into your "data" folder within the project directory.
